- The project maps 53 languages by comparing their daily use of approx. 100 words
  that deal with emotions, feelings and experiences

- By translating the words to 53 different languages I calculated their frequency in
  Twitter, Blogs & Newspapers using [this database](http://worldlex.lexique.org/),
  and created a 60X100 matrix with the frequency of each word in each language.

- By reducing the dimensions of that matrix using **PCA and T-SNE**, I achieved the
  2D map.

- The interface offers four different perspectives over the results - **Flags**, **Geographical**, **Language Families** & **Happy Planet Index**, each one of them
  may explain the proximity of languages.

- Additional info was added for each language:
  - Unique Word: Is the most commonly used emotional word for this language.
  - Words most used by this language: The words that are uniquely used when compared to other languages.
  - Countries speaking this language.
  - The language family that this language belongs to.
